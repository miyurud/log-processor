# EDGAR Log Processor benchmark

A stream processing benchmark based on a HTTP log data set published by Division of Economic and Risk Analysis (DERA) [1]. The data provides details of the usage of
publicly accessible EDGAR company filings in a simple but extensive manner. Each record in the data set consists of 16 different fields hence each event sent to the benchmark had
16 fields (*iij timestamp, ip, date, time, zone, cik, accession, extension, code, size, idx, norefer, noagent, find, crawler, and browser*).
